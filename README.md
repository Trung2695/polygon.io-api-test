[Polygon.io](https://polygon.io/) is a finance data API with a free option (as long as it is not streamed).
The purpose of the project is to familiarise using an API. Simple formulas (non-industry standard and potentially wrong) were used simply for easy verification.

The API provides historical data (because that is the free option), which the following code runs simple checks to see if there are any trends and potential reversals of the requested stock during the whole historical data time period.


A graph is also generated in order to cross-reference the highlighted period in the IDLE Shell, as the trends/reversals are printed there.
