[Polygon.io](https://polygon.io/) is a finance data API with a free option (as long as it is not streamed).
The purpose of the project is to familiarise using an API. Simple formulas (non-industry standard and potentially wrong) were used simply for easy verificaton.

The API provides historical data (because that is the free option), which the following code runs simple checks to see if there are any trends and potential reversals of the requested stock at the latest time period.
